# Contributing to WorkBridge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WorkBridge! To maintain the quality and security of the platform, we follow a structured development process.

## 1. Development Workflow

We follow the **GitHub Flow** model:
1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Commit** your changes with descriptive messages.
3. **Push** your branch to your fork.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch.

## 2. Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/short-description`: For new features.
- `fix/short-description`: For bug fixes.
- `docs/short-description`: For documentation updates.
- `refactor/short-description`: For code refactoring.

## 3. Pull Request Standards
A good PR should:
- Have a clear, descriptive title.
- Link to any related issues.
- Include a summary of the changes.
- Pass all automated tests and linting checks.
- Be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.

## 4. Coding Standards
- **Linting**: We use ESLint and Prettier. Ensure your code is formatted before submitting.
- **Testing**: Every new feature should include unit or integration tests.
- **Documentation**: Update the README or inline comments if your changes affect the public API or system logic.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat: add job filtering`, `fix: resolve login crash`).

## 5. Security Reporting
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, email the security team at security@workbridge.me (placeholder).
